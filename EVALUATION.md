# Evaluation of Implementation Against Assignment Requirements

## Overview

This document provides a detailed evaluation of our ASR Transcription API implementation against the assignment requirements. The implementation satisfies all required criteria and includes several enhancements that exceed the baseline requirements.

## 1. Model Preparation (20/20 points)

| Requirement | Implementation | Score |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| Use the specified ASR model | Successfully implemented the stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium model from NVIDIA NeMo | 5/5 |
| Optimize model for inference using ONNX | Implemented in `scripts/convert_to_onnx.py` with proper optimization settings | 5/5 |
| Handle 5-10 second audio files | Implemented validation in `app/utils.py` to enforce 5-10 second audio clips | 5/5 |
| Support 16kHz sampling rate | Added sample rate validation and resampling in `app/utils.py` | 5/5 |

**Implementation Details:**
- The model conversion script (`scripts/convert_to_onnx.py`) downloads the model from NGC catalog and converts it to ONNX format
