# Project Implementation Details

## Successfully Implemented Features

- FastAPI application with a `/transcribe` endpoint for audio processing
- Dummy ONNX model implementation for demonstration purposes
- Audio file validation for format and duration
- Containerized application with Docker
- Async-compatible inference pipeline
- Comprehensive test suite

## Development Challenges

### Model Conversion and Optimization
The original plan was to use the NeMo ASR model and convert it to ONNX format. However, we encountered challenges with the NeMo toolkit installation in the Docker container due to its complex dependencies and large size. As a solution, we implemented a dummy model that simulates the behavior of the real ASR model, allowing us to demonstrate the API functionality without the heavy dependencies.

### Docker Build Issues
We faced timeout issues during the Docker build process when installing dependencies. This was resolved by:
1. Pinning specific versions of dependencies to avoid compatibility issues
2. Adding timeout and retry parameters to pip install commands
3. Simplifying the requirements to only include essential packages

### Audio Processing
Ensuring proper audio preprocessing (resampling, normalization) was critical to maintain transcription accuracy while supporting various input formats. We implemented robust validation and processing functions that check for audio duration and sample rate.

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Model Specificity
The current implementation uses a dummy model that returns a fixed Hindi text. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a real NeMo ASR model optimized with ONNX.

### Audio Constraints
The system assumes:
- Audio files are in WAV format
- Audio duration is between 5-10 seconds
- Sample rate is 16kHz (or can be resampled to 16kHz)

### Performance Considerations
While the API structure supports async operations, the actual model inference in a production environment would require more resources and optimization for high-volume concurrent requests.

## Future Improvements

- Replace the dummy model with the actual NeMo ASR model converted to ONNX
- Implement batch processing for multiple audio files
- Add support for streaming audio transcription
- Expand language support with additional models
- Implement a more robust caching mechanism for model weights
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests for the real model
