## Development Challenges

### Model Conversion and Optimization
Converting the NeMo ASR model to ONNX format presented several challenges:

1. **Dependency Issues**: NVIDIA NeMo has complex dependencies that are challenging to satisfy, especially in containerized environments. We faced conflicts between PyTorch, CUDA, and NeMo versions.

2. **Memory Requirements**: The conversion process required significant memory, causing crashes on systems with limited resources.

3. **Trace Errors**: The NeMo model architecture includes complex attention mechanisms that were challenging to trace correctly for ONNX conversion.

4. **Apple Silicon Compatibility**: Getting the model to work efficiently on Apple Silicon required special handling for MPS (Metal Performance Shaders) acceleration.

**Solution**: We implemented a staged conversion process that:
- Isolated the model conversion environment
- Optimized memory usage during conversion
- Added provider detection to use CoreML/MPS on Apple Silicon
- Created a simplified conversion pathway for testing

### Docker Build Issues
We faced timeout issues during the Docker build process when installing dependencies. This was resolved by:
1. Pinning specific versions of dependencies to avoid compatibility issues
2. Adding timeout and retry parameters to pip install commands
3. Using a multi-stage build to separate model conversion from runtime
4. Implementing platform-specific optimizations

### Audio Processing Challenges
Several challenges were encountered in audio processing:

1. **Format Compatibility**: Ensuring consistent behavior across different audio formats and encodings.
2. **Resampling Quality**: Maintaining audio quality during resampling to 16kHz.
3. **Duration Validation**: Implementing accurate duration detection and validation.

**Solution**: We built a robust audio preprocessing pipeline that:
- Validates input format, duration, and sample rate
- Performs high-quality resampling when needed
- Normalizes audio to improve transcription quality
- Handles edge cases like mono/stereo conversion

## Limitations and Assumptions

### Model Specificity
- The model is specifically trained for Hindi language transcription
- Performance is best with clear speech in quiet environments
- The vocabulary is limited to the training corpus used by NeMo

### Audio Constraints
The system assumes:
- Audio files are in WAV format
- Audio duration is between 5-10 seconds
- Sample rate is 16kHz (or can be resampled to 16kHz)
- Clean speech without significant background noise

### Performance Characteristics
- Inference time on CPU: ~1-2 seconds per 5-second audio clip
- Inference time on Apple Silicon MPS: ~0.5-1 second per 5-second audio clip
- Memory usage: ~200-500MB depending on the platform
- Concurrent requests: The async implementation can handle multiple simultaneous requests, but performance will degrade based on available resources

## Known Issues
- The health endpoint may occasionally report `model_loaded: false` even when the model is operational
- Some specialized Hindi words or technical terms may not be accurately transcribed
- Very quiet audio sections may be ignored in transcription
- Performance on ARM-based systems (like Raspberry Pi) has not been tested

## Future Improvements

- Implement token-level confidence scores in the transcription output
- Add speaker diarization capabilities for multi-speaker audio
- Support for streaming audio transcription
- Expand language support with additional models
- Implement a more robust caching mechanism for model weights
- Add comprehensive unit and integration tests with real-world audio samples
- Enhance documentation with Swagger UI customizations
